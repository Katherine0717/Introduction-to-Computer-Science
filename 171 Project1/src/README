This program was written in IntelliJ.

In my game, the wall starts to move once the game started. It stops when the user finishes entering speed and angle.
For winning and losing the game, my program will randomly print out sentence that was already stored in the program.
Other things, like how many score the user will get, are the same with the handout.
